# PSUFilters-Rectification
This repository contains KiCad project of circuit with filtering, rectification and safety elements for linear power supply. Purpose of circuit is to adjust mains voltage to working voltage of cheap PSU modules. In this case PSU module DP50V5A is used, but other modules can be used with same circuit as well.
